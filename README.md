# Job_Search_Engine

This is the final project of information retrieval course. Our team designed a job search engine. I came up with this idea since most job search websites now could not satisfy the needs of master students. Job hunters can hardly distinguish the job for master students from jobs for others.

I focused on the core algorithm design in this project. I used Indeed API to download position information and saved this data in Json style. I used ElasticSearch to implement information retrieval algorithm part. There are many interesting functions in our system. For instance, our job search engine can analyze users' historical data and recommend a user the most suitable position.
